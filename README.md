# Hangman-Java

MVP* Release date : 26th July 2017

Welcome to my very first Java game.
This is your basic Hangman game and it uses the console for input and output.
The Hangman game was written in Java by following the Java track on treehouse.
Below, you will find some instructions -for beginners- on how to compile and run the program after you've downloaded all the files.
This is the MVP of my Hangman game and i will keep on updating it until it's done.

*MVP = Minimum Viable Product

instructions:

1) Download all the required files and place the whole folder on your computer(eg. on your desktop)
2) Go into the "src" file and copy the path. It should look like this(it depends) : C:\Users\<your_name>\Desktop\Hangman-Java\HangmanApp\src
3) Then, open a cmd(command prompt) if you are on windows and type in :
  ..> cd C:\Users\<your_name>\Desktop\Hangman-Java\HangmanApp\src
 After that, you have to compile the Main file(Hangman.java)by writing :
 ..> javac Hangman.java
 And then run it by writing :
 ..> java Hangman <place the word to guess> <username> !If you do not pass those 2 arguments, i've set the program to throw an exception :D.
4) That's it, make sure you share your opinion about my first game. Your feedback helps me a lot.

Hope you enjoy my game!
